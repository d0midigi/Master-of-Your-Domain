\chapter{Vulnerability Assessment \& Penetration Testing (VAPT) Report Writing}

This module assists the ethical hacker in fully understanding the process involves in conducting network Vulnerability audits and tests and transferring the output identified through those scans down in the form of a digestible reporting format. This module also determines the severity of the risks that networks face and the countermeasures needed to mitigate those risks.

Writing a report on network Vulnerability assessments is an art which is developed with years spent in the field of Information Security and its aim is to provide an insight into the nuances of report writing for aspiring ethical hackers.

We discuss Project Overview Statements and Project Scope Documentation, which form an important part of network analysis. To be successful, the network Vulnerability Assessment team will have to identify what the network security and the vulnerability analysis cover to finally make a comprehensive report both technical and non-technical audiences can understand.
