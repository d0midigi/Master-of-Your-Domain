Section 1: Prevalence of Active Directory Installations Worldwide

\textbf{Active Directory (AD) is a dominant force in corporate network access management and identity services globally.}

\textbf{Statistical Breakdown}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Approximately 80\% of organizations worldwide use Active Directory as their directory service, according to IS Decisions.
    \item Approximately 90\% of Fortune 1000 companies depend on Active Directory to manage their endpoints and assets.
    \item More than 95\% of large companies worldwide use Active Directory, according to Gartner.
    \item Microsoft Active Directory commands over 98\% of the market share in on-premises directory services.
    \item 
Today for many enterprise security postures is the often-expedited timeline from initial domain user compromise to full Domain Administrator control. This rapid escalation frequently prompts the critical defensive inquiry: \textit{ 'How does this occur?'}
\end{itemize}
The typical attack lifecycle often starts with targeted reconnaissance, such as targeted spearphishing campaigns or exploitation of vulnerabilities in public-facing web applications, enabling initial arbitrary code executions within the targeted network perimeter. Upon establishing this initial presence, the immediate subsequent phase involves extensive passive or active internal reconnaissance. This recon aims to identify critical assets, discover vulnerabilities and weak entry points into the core network, and map or map the network topology to facilitate the attacker's efforts to achieve privilege escalation, establish long-term persistence, and ultimately enable data exfiltration, often targeting the most sensitive information assets, or \textit{“crown jewels.”}

Although the granular execution details may vary, the overarching progression of such an attack adheres to a consistent thematic flow.

\textbf{1. Initial access (malware injection): } This often involves attack vectors such as spearphishing, impersonation, web exploits, or supply chain compromise.

\subsubsection{2. Internal Reconnaissance}
Post-compromise, the next step of an attacker after recon is to enumerate network resources, user accounts, group memberships, and potential misconfigurations.

\subsubsection{3. Credential Theft}
Harvesting credentials through various cracking techniques, including memory scraping, hash dumping, or keylogging.

\subsubsection{4. Exploitation & Privilege Escalation}
Leveraging identified vulnerabilities or misconfigurations to increase access rights, culminating in domain administrator account breach and compromise.

\subsubsection{5. Data Access & Exfiltration}
Accessing and extracting targeted sensitive information.

\subsubsection{6. Persistence}
Establishing mechanisms to maintain long-term access to the compromised environment, even after system reboots, system reimages, or credential changes.

Group Policy Preferences (GPPs) stored in the \texttt{SYSVOL} share./

\subsection{Passwords in SYSVOL \& Group Policy Preferences (GPPs)}

This attack vector represents one of the most straightforward methods for an attacker to escalate their privileges within an Active Directory (AD) environment, and often one that requires minimal specialized tooling to accomplish. This attack capitalizes on a historical vulnerability and common misconfiguration within ADs \textit{Group Policy Objects (GPOs).}

\subsubsection{Understanding the Vulnerability}

The `SYSVOL` share is a domain-wide \textit{ distributed file system (DFS) } share within Active Directory, critical for domain operations. It hosts essential data such as logon scripts, Group Policy data, and other domain-wide information that requires replication across all Domain Controllers (DCs). Crucially, all authenticated users within the domain have \textbf{ read access} to the `SYSVOL` share, located at `<DOMAIN>\textbackslash{}SYSVOL\textbackslash{}<DOMAIN>\textbackslash{}Policies\textbackslash{}.

Prior to 2012, when Group Policy Preferences (GPPs) were introduced, Microsoft implemented a feature allowing administrators to embed credentials (e.g., for creating local users, scheduling tasks, or configuring services) directly within GPP XML files. These passwords were encrypted using \textbf{AES-256}; however, a severe oversight occurred: Microsoft publicly released the \textbf{AES encryption key (shared secret)} on MSDN.

Consequently, any authenticated domain user can enumerate the `SYSVOL` share, specifically searching for XML files associated with GPPs. The most commonly targeted files include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item groups.xml (for Local Users and Groups GPPs)
    \item scheduledtasks.xml (for Scheduled Tasks GPPs)
    \item services.xml (for Services GPPs)
\end{itemize}

These XML files often contain a field named \textbf{“cpassword,”} which holds the AES-256 encrypted password.

\textbf{Note:}

\textbf{AES-256} refers to the \textit{\textbf{Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)}} algorithm using a \textbf{256-bit key length. }It is a highly secure and widely adopted \textit{\textbf{symmetric block cipher}} used globally, including the United States Federal Government, for protecting sensitive digital data at rest or in transit.

\subsection{\textbf{What Is AES?}}

AES is a \textit{symmetric block cipher}, meaning it uses the \textit{same secret key} for both encrypting plaintext (human-readable data) into ciphertext (encrypted, machine-readable data, binary, 1s and 0s), and decrypting ciphertext back into plaintext. It operates on fixed-size blocks of data, specifically \textbf{128-bit blocks} (16 bytes), regardless of the key size.

The algorithm was established by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001, replacing the older \textit{Data Encryption Standard (DES)} due to DESs shorter key length and susceptibility to brute-force attacks.

\subsubsection{\textbf{Why 256?}}

The “256” in AES-256 indicates the \textbf{length of the cryptographic key} used in the encryption and decryption process. AES supports three primary key lengths: 128-bit, 192-bit, and 256-bit. A longer key length directly translates to a significantly higher number of possible keys, making brute-force attacks (trying to guess and use every possible key until the correct one is found) exponentially more difficult.

For AES-256, there are 2\textsuperscript{256} possible combinations for the key. To put this into perspective, cracking AES-256 through brute-force with current computing technology is considered computationally infeasible, even for the most powerful supercomputers, taking billions of years, literally. It’s often referred to as “military-grade” encryption because it is approved by the U.S. government for securing classified information, including data up to the :TOP SECRET” level.

\subsection{\textbf{How AES-256 Works}}

The AES algorithm operates through a series of complex mathematical transformations performed over multiple \textbf{rounds. }The number of rounds depends on the key length:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{\textbf{AES-128: }10 rounds}
    \item \textbf{\textbf{AES-291: }12 rounds}
    \item \textbf{\textbf{AES-256: 14 rounds}}
\end{itemize}

Each round consists of a sequence of four fundamental operations applied to the 128-bit data block, represented as a 4 x 4 matrix of bytes:

\textbf{1. \texttt{SubBytes} (Byte Substitution): }Each byte in the data block is replaced with another byte using a predefined substitution box (S-box). This introduces \textbf{ non-linearity, } a crucial property for cryptographic strength.

\textbf{2. \texttt{ShiftRows} (Row Shifting): }The rows of the data matrix are cyclically shifted to the left by different offsets. This step provides \textbf{diffusion} by spreading the byte values throughout the block.

\textbf{3. \texttt{MixColumns} (Column Mixing): }A mathematical operation (matrix multiplication) is performed on each column of the data matrix, further scrambling the data and improving diffusion. This step is skipped in the final round.

\textbf{4. \texttt{AddRoundKey} (Key Mixing): }A \textbf{round key}, derived from the original 256-bit secret key through a process called \textit{\textbf{key expansion}}, is combined with the current data block using a \textit{bitwise XOR} operation. This step directly integrates the secret key material into the encryption process.

These operations are performed repeatedly for the specified number of rounds. The final round omits the \texttt{MixColumns} step and concludes with an \texttt{AddRoundKey} operation, producing the final ciphertext.

\subsubsection{\textbf{Key Features \& Applications}}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{\textbf{Symmetric Key Algorithm: }Uses the same key for encryption and decryption (goes both ways). This makes it efficient for encrypting large volumes of data.}
    \item \textbf{\textbf{Block Cipher: }Processes data in fixed-sized blocks of 128-bits.}
    \item \textbf{\textbf{High Security: }Considered virtually unbreakable by brute-force attacks with current technology, offering durable protection against unauthorized access.}
    \item \textbf{\textbf{Substitution-Permutation Network (SPN): }The underlying structure of the algorithm, involving alternating layers of substitutions and permutations to create strong cryptographic mixing.}
    \item \textbf{\textbf{Widely Adopted: }AES-256 is the standard for securing data in various applications, including:}
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
    \item\begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{\textbf{Data at Rest (DAR): }Full Disk Encryption (FDE) (e.g., BitLocker, FileVault) and database encryption.}
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{\textbf{Data in Transit (DIT): }Secure communication protocols like TLS/SSL (HTTPS), VPNs, and wireless security (WPA2/3).}
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{\textbf{File Encryption: }For sensitive documents and archives.}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Although AES-256 is highly secure, its effectiveness ultimately depends on proper implementation and \textbf{ secrecy of the key. }A strong algorithm cannot compensate for weak key management practices.

\textbf{Mitigation}

Mitigating the risk of attackers leveraging exposed credentials within SYSVOL and Group Policy Preferences (GPPs) is crucial for preventing

\textbf{Assume Breach}

"Assume breach" is a security principle and a mindset that dictates that a security system should be designed and operated under the assumption that a breach has already occurred or will inevitably occur. It emphasizes proactive measures to detect, respond to, and mitigate the impact of breaches rather than solely focusing on preventing them. This approach is a core component of the Zero-Trust Architecture, which aims to minimize the impact of potential breaches by limiting access and trust within the network.

\textbf{Backdoor}

A backdoor is a secret method of bypassing normal authentication or security measures to gain access to a computer system, network, or application. It is like a hidden entrance that allows attackers to bypass security controls and maintain persistent access.

\textbf{Canary Tokens}

Canary tokens are digital tripwires used in cybersecurity to detect unauthorized access to sensitive data or systems. They are essentially decoy files, URLs, or API keys strategically placed within a network or application, designed to trigger an alert when accessed by an attacker or malicious actor. This early warning system helps defenders identify potential breaches and respond quickly.

\textbf{Credential Hygiene}

Credential hygiene refers to the practices and processes involved in managing and protecting authentication credentials such as passwords, tokens, and keys. It is crucial to maintain security across various systems and applications, particularly in CI/CD pipelines and SaaS environments. Effective credential hygiene minimizes the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security incidents.

\textbf{External Trust}

An external trust in Active Directory is a trust relationship established between two domains in different forests. It allows users in one domain to access resources in the other domain, even if the domains are not part of the same forest. This type of trust is often used when there is a need for resource sharing between organizations with separate Active Directory environments.
\textbf{Forest Trust}

Forest trusts in Active Directory are a type of trust relationship established between the root domains of two separate Active Directory forests. They allow users and resources in one forest to be accessed by users in the other forest, effectively creating a bridge between the two separate domains.
