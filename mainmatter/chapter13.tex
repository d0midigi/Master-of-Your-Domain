\begin{abstract}
Active Directory (AD) forms the backbone of identity authentication and access management of which many Windows domain-based networks rely on to safely access a network's resources in an authenticated and authorized manner.  Relying on the Kerberos protocol for user and device verification, attackers, too, understand the amount of reliance any given company has to depend on the Kerberos to get them in to get their work done and manage the network properly so as to not disrupt end-users with workflows and processes. This reliance makes AD a prime target for attackers. This chapter explores the vulnerabilities of AD, discuss why after so many years since its release does it still remain critically vulnerable, and specifically focuses on Kerberos-based ticketing attacks that exploit inherent weaknesses in the protocol itself. The goal is to provide the reader with a comprehensive understanding of these threats to include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Attack Analysis: Examine various Kerberos attacks commonly used against AD. Each attack will be further analyzed to understand its objectives and mechanics.
    \item Practical Implementation: Demonstrate the execution of these cyberattacks within a controlled virtual laboratory environment.
    \item Detection Strategies: Explore effective methods for identifying these attacks by analyzing system logs and network traffic.
    \item Mitigation \& Response: Propose specific countermeasures and response strategies to minimize the impact of successful cyberattacks against AD infrastructure.
    

\end{itemize}

This chapter will detail each cyberattack, providing a practical, hands-on approach. We will then discuss the attacks in a consolidated manner, comparing and contrasting their effects based on key metrics. Our findings will reveal that, while implementing these attacks can be challenging, their detection often proves even more difficult. Moreover, the potential damage from successful cyberattacks is significant; therefore, defenders must understand and fully grasp the concept of continuous log monitoring, coupled with strict adherence to mitigation and response best practices, is crucial for maintaining the security of AD environments.

\section{Introduction to Kerberos}
The Kerberos authentication protocol was developed by MIT, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as a solution to address security problems and challenges inherent in communications over insecure Internet channels. According to its official documentation, Kerberos leverages strong cryptographic techniques that enable a client to securely verify its identity to a server, and vice versa, even when operating across an untrusted network environment. This mutual authentication process not only establishes trust between the client and server but also allows them to encrypt subsequent communications, thereby safeguarding the confidentiality and integrity of their data exchanges throughout the transaction. Despite these significant security benefits. Kerberos is not without its vulnerabilities and presents several notable weaknesses, for example, a major drawback of a centralized authentication system is that it creates a single point of failure. Should the \textit{Authentication Service (AS)} or the \textit{Ticket Granting Service (TGS)} experiences downtime or becomes unavailable, users will be unable to gain access to any services. To mitigate this risk, multiple servers are deployed for redundancy, and data is replicated across them to ensure data is duplicated (for redundancy purposes) and is continuously available.

Another notable weakness is the critical requirement for the system's proper functioning in that all participants maintain synchronized clocks. If the time settings between clients and servers fall out of sync, the issued Kerberos tickets become invalid, preventing anyone from authenticating and accessing network resources.

Additionally, because all cryptographic keys are stored on a single central server, this design (in and of itself) presents a significant security risk. If an attacker successfully breaches this server, they could potentially impersonate any user by gaining access to their authentication credentials, thereby compromising the entire system; therefore, safeguarding the central server and implementing strong security measures is paramount for defenders to better protect against such attacks.

Exploiting these vulnerabilities is critically important because Kerberos serves as the default authentication protocol within Windows networks, which are extensively utilized across \textit{Local Area Network (LAN) } environments. Successfully carrying out such attacks can lead to varying degrees of compromise within a Windows domain, underscoring the necessity of thoroughly understanding both the nature of these attacks and the methods by which they can be detected and prevented. Furthermore, as highlighted in Figure 1, attacking the Kerberos protocol presents significant challenges, it begs to ask the question why are will still so damn vulnerable after all these years?

Furthermore, attacking the Kerberos authentication protocol presents three critical challenges often faced by defenders:

1. Access:
Once an attacker gains local administrator privileges on a compromised machine, they can extract additional credentials stored on that system. These credentials, if not promptly identified and removed, enable an attacker to move laterally throughout the network-accessing other devices and systems beyond the initial toehold. This lateral movement allows the attacker to escalate their privileges further eventually gaining unauthorized entry to mission-critical and service-dependent assets within the operational infrastructure. In essence, initial compromise acts as springboard for broader network infiltration and deeper system control.

2. Obscurity:
To bypass security controls and avoid detection by monitoring tools, attackers often leverage Kerberos tickets to impersonate legitimate users. By reusing valid Kerberos tickets, they can effectively bypass usual authentication mechanisms without raising immediate suspicion. This tactic allows attackers to operate covertly within the network, masking their activities and erasing standard authentication log entries that would typically signal unauthorized access attempts. As a result, attackers remain hidden, blending in as trusted users while conducting malicious actions unnoticed.

3. Persistence:
Maintaining a long-term, undetected presence within a victim’s network is a key goal for attackers seeking to extract information gradually. Kerberos-based attacks provide a critical advantage in achieving persistence because attackers can maintain valid session tokens even after user credentials are changed or passwords are reset. This means that malicious actors can continue to utilize Kerberos tickets to sustain their access and operations over extended periods, effectively “living off the land” without raising alarms. The ability to persist despite credential updates makes Kerberos attacks particularly challenging to detect and remediate, giving attackers the time they need to exfiltrate data or compromise systems at their own pace.
