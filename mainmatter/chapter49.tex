\subsection{\textbf{Password Spraying}}

\subsubsection{\textbf{What It Is}}

\textbf{Short-form: }\textit{Brute-forcing accounts using }\textit{\textbf{one password across many users}}\textit{ to avoid lockouts.}

If you’re going to understand password spraying, drop the Hollywood idea of brute-force hacking. This isn’t about hammering one account with thousands of guesses until it breaks. That’s noisy, detectable, and usually ineffective. Password spraying flips that script. Instead of one account and many passwords, you try one password across many accounts - and you do it slowly, strategically. That’s how attackers stay under that radar. That’s why and how they ultimately win.

Start by gathering usernames. In most corporate environments, usernames follow patterns - first initial plus last name, first name dot last name, or just the full email address. These conventions are your entry point. You can scrape names from LinkedIn, company press releases, breach dumps, or even public Git commits. If you can figure out the format and collect a few dozen plausible names, you’ve got a working list. Don’t worry if every name isn’t valid. A small percentage of hits is all you need.

Next, you focus on the password. This is where you need to think like an employee, not an attacker. Most people don’t pick strong passwords; they pick ones that barely meet the minimum policy. That means capital letters, lowercase letters, a number, and maybe a special character. They reuse the same format year after year. Think `Winter2025!`, `Welcome123`, or `CompanyName@2025`. Your job is to build a shortlist of these probable passwords. Ten good guesses are better than a thousand random ones. Quality beats quantity in spraying.

Now here’s the key: to avoid triggering lockout policies, you spray one password across all usernames - just one. Then you stop. You wait. Maybe it’s 30 minutes, maybe it’s several hours. Then you try the next password. Most security systems are configured to lock accounts after a few failed attempts - but they don’t correlate failures across many accounts. That’s the blind spot you’re exploiting. You stretch the attack across time and across accounts. It’s deliberate. It’s methodical. And if done right, it’s invisible.

You need tools that let you control timing, delay intervals, and error handling. For Windows environments, \textbf{CrackMapExec} is a staple - it can spray passwords across Active Directory domains without tripping alerts. For web login portalsw, you might use the \textbf{Burp Suite} with custom scripts, or tools like \textbf{Medusa} and \textbf{thc-Hydra.} Always make sure your tools respect timing limits and don’t flood the target. Your goal isn’t to crash a system. It’s to slip through it.

When a password hits, and you get yourself a valid set of credentials, that’s your toehold (e.g., your foothold). With just one working login, you can potentially access email, internal portals, or even VPN services. From there, it’s a short hop to lateral movement. If the target has no MFA, you’re in with no further resistance. If MFA is enabled, you’ll need to pivot to other techniques - phishing proxies, prompt bombing, or intercepting OTPs. But for now, your mission is simple: get that first crack in the wall.

Don’t assume defenders are watching. Most environments collect logs but don’t analyze them. Security teams are overwhelmed with noise. SIEM alerts are ignored unless something explodes. Your spraying activity, if done carefully, becomes part of that background noise - just another blip amidst the chaos. That’s the paradox: more alerts mean less attention to each one. So you don’t need to be silent - you just need to be quiet enough to blend in.

Understand this: password spraying isn’t glamorous. It’s not about clever code or elite exploits. It’s about human laziness and predictable behavior. It’s about exploiting policy loopholes and user habits. Most companies don’t train their users very well, and most users will always choose convenience over security. That’s what you’re counting on. And unless defenders drastically change how they think, spraying will keep working. Because (\textit{many}) people don’t change.

\textbf{Brute-Forcing}

Brute-forcing is raw, unrefined force. It’s not elegant, and it’s not subtle - but it works if the conditions are right. Think of it like kicking down a door instead of picking the lock. Sometimes that’s exactly what you need. But understand this: brute-forcing only works if the environment is weak, exposed, or poorly defended. So before you throw every password in the dictionary at a login form, make sure it’s worth the noise.

The core idea is simple: guess every possible password until something hits. That’s it. No finesse. Just firepower. But, in the real-world, you don’t get to brute-force like in movies. You have rate limits, lockout policies, IP bans, bot detection, and time constraints, and other security barriers through which you need to penetrate that can sometimes span hours, days, months, or years! This also means you need to know \textit{\textbf{when}} to use brute-force, \textit{\textbf{how}} to shape it, and \textit{\textbf{where}} it has the highest chance of success. If you’re doing it blindly, you’re wasting your time - and probably getting blocked in under a minute.

Let’s break it down. Brute-forcing comes in two main forms: \textbf{online} and \textbf{offline}.

Online brute-forcing means hitting a live authentication endpoint - web logins, SSH servers, FTP, APIs - anything you can send, or pass credentials to. But online targets are noisy. They monitor traffic. They track login attempts. Every request leaves a track and if you’re sloppy, you  light up their dashboards like a Christmas tree (Xmas attack hint, hint). You’ve got to slow it down, route your traffic, rotate IPs, spoof headers, and space out your requests. Otherwise, you’re toast before you even get a valid login.

Offline brute-forcing is what you do when you’ve already stolen hashes - maybe from a database dump, a memory scrape, or a compromised system. That’s where you can go all out. No rate limits, no lockouts, no prying eyes. Just you and the hash, and all the time in the world. That’s where brute-force shines. But we will hit that in the account cracking section. Right now, let’s stay on the online side.

Dictionary attacks are the first step. You don’t try \textbf{every} possible password from `aaaaaa` to `ZZZZZZ` unless you absolutely know that you’re dealing with a four-character PIN. Instead, you use real-world \textit{wordlists, }leaked password databases found on breach forums, and target lists based on social engineering\textit{.}

Did You Know

One wordlist that is the most popular known for garnering the most hits when used is the `rockyou.txt` text-based wordlist. 

People reuse passwords like `123456`, `qwerty`, `letmein`, and `Password1!`. These aren’t guesses. These are practically defaults. You start with that. Then you move into permutations: adding years, symbols, common substitutions. `Summer 2025!`, `Admin123`, `P@ssw0rd!` - they’re predictable, and you need to think like someone lazy, not clever.

Now, about tools. You’ve got options, and they all have their own strengths depending on what you want your outcome or goal to be. \textbf{Hydra} is the classic. Fast, versatile, supports tons of network protocols. \textbf{Medusa} is similar - some prefer it for its stability. \textbf{Ncrack} for more advanced use. If you’re targeting web logins, \textbf{Burp Suite} with custom intruder configus gives you full control, especially when dealing with CSRF tokens, headers, or JavaScript-laced forms. The point is: don’t let the tool run wild. You shape the attack. You control speed, delays, retries. You keep it under the radar.

Most important thing: you need intel before you strike. Don’t brute-force blindly. Recon the target. Look at the homepage, at its login page. Is there a CAPTCHA? A lockout message? Does it rate-limit? Analyze the HTTP responses. Watch for subtle behavior changes - response codes, timings, redirects. That tells you how the system reacts to failures. Then you tune your attack to fly just under that threshold. You don’t kick in the door; you lean on it until the lock cracks.

Brute-forcing is rarely your first move. It’s your last resort or your follow-up. Maybe you tried spraying and got nothing. Maybe you only have a handful of usernames, and no strong password leads. Then, maybe, it’s time to bring out the brute-force play. But always measure risk versus reward. If the target has solid defenses in place, you’ll get burned. If it’s soft and squishy and exposed? You’ll be in before they even realize the door was open.

Remember - brute-force is a hammer. And hammers are only useful when you’re hitting the right kind of nail. Don’t use it for everything. But when it’s time? Hit hard. Hit smart. And don’t miss.

Account Cracking

This is what I like to call the third tool in the account attacking trifecta. You’re not banging on doors anymore. You’re working with what you’ve already gathered. It’s post-exploitation. It’s war at the keyboard.

Cracking accounts is what happens \textbf{after} the breach. You’ve already gotten in, or you’ve already stolen something valuable - hashes, credential dumps, leaked databases. Now it’s time to turn that raw loot into real access. This is offline work. Quiet. No alarms. No rate-limits. Just you and the data, grinding away, turning cryptography into plaintext one weak password at a time.

Let’s start with the basics. A password hash isn’t a password. It’s a one-way cryptographic fingerprint of a password. But the problem is, humans are lazy. They reuse passwords. They pick predictable ones. And the algorithms, while strong on paper, often run on hardware that doesn’t enforce proper cost. That’s your edge. If someone stored hashes using MD5, SHA1, or even unsalted NTLM, it’s game over. You’ll crack that wide open with minimal effort. You don’t break the hash - you \textbf{reverse-engineer} it by comparing it against known inputs. That’s the whole game.

Your first task is to collect the hashes. Maybe you dumped a SAM file from a Windows box. Maybe you exfiltrated a MySQL database or grabbed `/etc/shadow` from a *nix target. Doesn’t matter. The goal is to get those hashed credentials out of the system and into your cracking rig. Once you have them, you identify the algorithm - NTLM, `bcrypt`, SHA-256, `scrypt`. Tools like `hashid` or `hashcat –example-hashes` will help you sort that out fast.

Now comes the grind. You load up \textbf{Hashcat }or \textbf{JtR}, point them at your hash list, and let the war begin. If you’re doing it right, you’re using GPU acceleration - multiple cards, maybe even a rented cloud rig. This isn’t 2005; CPU cracking is dead. Speed is everything. NTLM hashes can be cracked at billions of guesses per second. Bcrypt? Much slower - but still vulnerable if the user picked garbage. You tune your attack style based on the algorithm.

There are several cracking modes, and you need to know when to use each.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{\textbf{Straight dictionary: }Run a big password list against the hashes. Simple. Fast. Works well against weak targets.}
    \item \textbf{\textbf{Rules-based: }Modify words on the fly - adding numbers, symbols, capitalizations. Takes your base dictionary and makes it dynamic in use.}
    \item \textbf{\textbf{Mask attacks: }For when you know part of the password - like it always starts with `Welcome` or ends in `2025!`.}
    \item \textbf{\textbf{Hybrid: }Combine wordlists with brute-force components, like appending all two-digit numbers to every word.}
    \item \textbf{\textbf{Rainbow tables: }Precompiled hash lookups. Less relevant these days unless you’re targeting really outdated systems.}
\end{itemize}
And don’t forget: salting changes the game. A \textit{salt} is a random value added to each password before hashing to prevent reuse. Good salts make rainbow tables worthless and slow down cracking massively. But a lot of systems mess this up. They reuse salts, store them insecurely, or don’t use them at all. Your job is to figure out what kind of system you’re first dealing with. If it’s lazy or misconfigured, cracking becomes easy again.

The goal is always the same: extract real, working passwords from that pile of hashes. Once you have them, you test them. Maybe they still work on the original system. Maybe the user reused the same password across platforms - email, VPN, cloud services. One cracked password can light up an entire infrastructure. Especially if it belongs to an admin.

This is where you go from attacker to owner. Not just access, but \textbf{persistence. }You start implanting backdoors, escalating privileges, pivoting inside the network. Or maybe you go black market - dump the cracked credentials on dark web forums, sell the logins in bulk, or trade them for access to even bigger targets that are being publicly sold and traded on the deep and dark web. Credential cracking has a whole economy behind it. It’s not just a technique. It’s now a business model.

And to be clear: cracking isn’t some niche skill. It’s fundamental. Every pentester, red teamer, or adversarial group uses it. Because no matter how advanced the defenses are, they all rely on users making good password choices. And users don’t. They never have. They never will. They’re predictable, lazy, and rushed - and that makes them exploitable.

So build your rigs. Gather your dictionaries and tune your rulesets. Chip away at those hashes, knowing that behind every cracked one is a real person’s access - and likely a whole system behind it. This is where quiet, patient work turns into loud, real-world compromise.

And once you’re in? You’re not guessing anymore. You’re pwning.

\subsubsection{\textbf{Defense}}

If you’re defending a system and you don’t understand the attacker’s view, you’re already behind. You don’t win by hoping bad things go away or won’t happen - you win by assuming they already have. That’s the posture you need as a defender. Security isn’t about tools or checklists. It’s about adversarial thinking. You’re in a constant game of chess with people who are patient, focused, and creative in their move-making. You’re playing defense with a reactive mindset, they’ll walk right past you. Your job is to think ahead, not just react. Every log, every request, every system setting - it’s either helping you or helping them.

Attackers have the advantage of choice. They choose the time, the vector, the place. You? You’re stuck defending everything, all the time, without room for error. They only need to be right once. You need to be right constantly. That pressure forces discipline. It forces strategies. And most importantly, it forces clarity. You have to understand the attacker’s toolkit - not because you want to use it, but because it’s your job to spot it in motion before it becomes a full-blown breach.

Understanding attacks like password spraying, brute-force attempts, and offline cracking isn’t optional. It’s the frontline. These aren’t just techniques - they’re the reality of how most real-world intrusions start. You can obsess with zero-days, malware payloads, or nation-state actors all you want. But most successful compromises still come down to weak credentials, poor configuration, and a missed log line. The kill chain almost always begins with something simple - and the defenders who survive know how to see it coming.

Defending isn’t just about building walls of layered security mechanisms - it’s also about knowing what kind of threats those walls need to stop. A good defender doesn’t chase every possible scenario. You prioritize. You look at the threat landscape and focus on what actually happens, not what \textit{\textbf{might}} happen. Credential-based attacks do happen. They are very real. They’re cheap, scalable, and successful when deployed. They’re used by script kiddies mainly, ransomware groups, and APTs alike. If you’re not building your defense stack around this reality, you’re wasting cycles.

Here’s the brutal truth: most environments are still vulnerable to simple attacks. I’m not talking about zero-day exploits or complex malware chains. I’m talking about credential reuse, predictable passwords, and login endpoints exposed to the internet with zero rate-limiting applied. If that describes your setup, then you’re not just on the radar - you’re a blinking red target.

You don’t fight off attackers with wishful thinking. You do it with visibility, layered controls, and a firm grasp on what ‘normal’ looks like in your environment. If you can’t tell a legitimate login from a slow-motion spray attack, you’re flying high and blind. And if your users pick passwords like `Company2025!`, you can’t afford to ignore authentication hygiene. Your entire infrastructure - firewalls, EDR, patching - means nothing if someone can walk in the front door using a password they guessed from LinkedIn.

Let’s be clear about something else: good attackers know your policies better than your users do. If you enforce quarterly password resets, they’ll time their attacks around that cycle. If you use SSO or MFA, they’ll look for fallback paths and legacy endpoints you forgot about. They read your documentation online, they fingerprint your infrastructure online, and they treat your login portals like open books. You can’t hide behind ‘security via obscurity.’ You fight back by building bullet-proof layered, intentional defenses.

This is why mindset matters more than the tools themselves. It’s not about which vendor’s solution you deploy. It’s about how well you understand the battle. Tools will and do fail. Logs don’t always show you what matters. But if you understand what attackers are doing - and \textbf{why} - you can, in anticipation of, build traps, detect anomalies, and respond faster than they’ll expect you to. That’s what it means to \textit{defend with purpose. }You don’t just react. You counter.

\textbf{What You’re Really Up Against}

You’re not defending against a toolset. You’re defending against a mindset. That’s a hard pill for many teams to swallow. They treat security like an engineering checklist, and when something goes awry, they blame the product. But the real adversary isn’t Burp Suite or Hashcat - it’s the person wielding them. And that person is often more patient, more curious, and more invested than the team that is defending the target.

Understand the economics of your enemy. Brute-force attacks, password spraying, and account cracking are cheap. They cost almost nothing to execute. \$10US gets you a server. \$50US gets you a fresh list of valid email addresses to abuse. Public wordlists are free. Cracking rigs can be rented by the hour. You’re defending against an industrial process - optimized, modular, and persistent. You can’t beat it with static defenses. You beat it by forcing cost back onto the attacker.

Attackers don’t care about your firewall rules. They care if your VPN portal is exposed to the internet and if you’re still using “Spring2025!” as a default password. They care about your forgotten admin accounts, your legacy services with no MFA, and your failure to log failed attempts in a centralized system. These are the cracks they crawl through. Not because they’re magic - but because they’re \textbf{everywhere.}

You’ve probably already been tested. You just didn’t know it. The password spray that hit your login endpoint last week didn’t set off any alarms because it was smart - one password, thousands of usernames, stretched over hours. Your rate-limiting didn’t trip, and your logs were buried in noise or overwritten because they were full. The attacker left, or maybe they didn’t. Maybe they got one valid hit. You wouldn’t know unless you were watching for it. That’s what you’re up against - attacks designed to succeed by \textbf{looking like nothing happened.}

Credential-based attacks scale with precision. Automation means one attacker can target a hundred organizations in parallel. If you environment is even slightly compromised, they’ll find the weakest link before your SOC finishes morning coffee. And they’ll come back. These aren’t one-off hits. These are repeatable processes. Think pipelines, not hackers in hoodies. This is professionalized exploitation.

You need to start asking yourself better questions. Not “Are we using MFA?” but “Is MFA enforced everywhere, including on backup login paths?” Not “Are we logging login failures?” But “Do we correlate failures across accounts over time?” Not “Are we safe?” but “Where do we expect attackers to hit, and what happens when they do?” Security isn’t about binary, static answers. It’s about probabilities and pressure points.

That’s the mental shift that separates teams that survive from teams that get breached. You stop treating credential attacks as low-tier noise and start recognizing them for what they truly are: the front line of modern compromise. Once you understand the game, you can start playing to win.

\textbf{Defending Against Password Spraying Attacks}

Password spraying isn’t quiet. Although that’s the entire point of the attack. It’s not about brute-force - it’s about \textbf{plausibility}. A single failed login to one user account every few hours? That won’t set off your alert systems - unless you’ve designed it to. Most orgs haven’t. They track account lockouts or a high number of failed logins per account, but spraying bypassses both. It targets the \textbf{horizontal plane} - a single password against hundreds or thousands of users. It stays low, spreads out, and blends in.

So how do you spot it? You don’t look for noise. You look for \textbf{consistency}. Same password, different usernames, repeated across a timeframe. You pivot your detection model to focus on \textbf{patterns across users}, not just within one. A traditional SIEM may not be wired for this, but you can shape canned queries to catch it. Look for authentication failures that occur from the same source IP or agent, hitting different accounts, with an identical password attempt. That’s the thread you pull.

Now here’s the trap a lot of defenders fall into: account lockouts. They crank down lockout thresholds - 3 or 5 failed logins, and the account is locked. That might seem smart and all, but it turns into \textbf{denial of service bait}. Attackers can abuse it to lock out every user in the company with just a few failed attempts each. Suddenly your entire organization is frozen, and your helpdesk is underwater. That’s not defense. That’s self-sabotage. So forget hard lockouts. Think of adaptive\textbf{ response} instead.

What does adaptive look like? Start with \textbf{progressive backoff} - the more failures from a source, the longer you delay responses. Add rate-limiting per IP, per user, and even per password. Most systems miss the last one. If you see a single password tried across dozens of accounts, stop the bleed. Throttle or block it outright. That pattern almost never happens by accident. You don’t need AI for this - you need common sense in your log logic.

Geo-behavioral controls help too. If you’re seeing authentication attempts for local user accounts from foreign IP ranges, especially in volume, that should flag early. Most password sprays are automated and launched from known cloud providers - DigitalOcean, AWS, OVH, Hetzner. Map those IP ranges and monitor login attempts that originate from them. No need to block them globally, but watch them like a hawk. They’re breeding grounds for credential abuse.

Let’s talk about MFA - everyone’s favorite silver bullet. Yes, multi-factor authentication kills most spray attacks dead, but only if it is universal and enforced. If you leave legacy endpoints open - SMTP auth, IMAP, or VPN gateways with fallback passwords - you’ve left the back door wide open. Attackers will find the path of least resistance. Your MFA doesn’t matter if your protocols still allow for password-only access somewhere in the stack. Audit everything. Rip out or wrap every endpoint with security policy enforcements.

Another vector you need to close: \textbf{shared credentials. }For starters this kills any accountability. Period. Secondly, you’d be shocked how many companies still use shared local admin accounts or generic department logins. These get hit hard by sprays because they’re predictable - “admin,” “marketing,” “sales,” - and they’re often left exempt from MFA or password expiration. Treat every shared account like a VIP target. Either eliminate it or wrap it in iron.

And don’t forget the human layer (what I like to call Layer 8 of the OSI model). Password policies shouldn’t just tick compliance boxes on some checklist. They should force unpredictability. Ban common patterns - `Season+Year`, `CompanyName+123`,. Enforce long passwords, sure - but more importantly, \textbf{block known bad passwords outright}. Use breached password checks in near-real-time. Microsoft, Okta, and Duo all support this. If the user is trying to use a password that is in the top 1,000 most commonly globally, deny it. No debate. No override.

Finally, visibility is non-negotiable. You need full logging on every auth attempt. Successful and failed. IP, user agent, timestamp, endpoint - all of it. Pipe that data into something you can query fast. Create dashboards that track login failures across accounts, and watch for slow-motion sprays that don’t trigger alerts on their own. Remember: they’re trying to blend in. Your job is to zoom out and see the mosaic for what it is.

\textbf{Assume Breach}

"Assume breach" is a security principle and a mindset that dictates that a security system should be designed and operated under the assumption that a breach has already occurred or will inevitably occur. It emphasizes proactive measures to detect, respond to, and mitigate the impact of breaches rather than solely focusing on preventing them. This approach is a core component of Zero Trust Architecture, which aims to minimize the impact of potential breaches by limiting access and trust within the network.

\textbf{Canary Tokens}

Canary tokens are digital tripwires used in cybersecurity to detect unauthorized access to sensitive data or systems. They are essentially decoy files, URLs, or API keys strategically placed within a network or application, designed to trigger an alert when accessed by an attacker or malicious actor. This early warning system helps defenders identify potential breaches and respond quickly.

\textbf{Credential Hygiene}

Credential hygiene refers to the practices and processes involved in managing and protecting authentication credentials like passwords, tokens, and keys. It's crucial for maintaining security across various systems and applications, particularly in CI/CD pipelines and SaaS environments. Effective credential hygiene minimizes the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security incidents.

The Local Security Authority (LSA) is a security subsystem within the Windows operating system that manages and enforces local security policies. It's responsible for crucial tasks like authenticating users during sign-in, verifying passwords, and handling access tokens. Essentially, the LSA acts as a gatekeeper, controlling access to resources and ensuring only authorized users and processes can interact with the system.

\textbf{Service Principal Name (SPN)}

A Service Principal Name (SPN) is a unique identifier for a service instance, used in Active Directory for Kerberos authentication. It links a service to a specific service account, enabling clients to locate and authenticate the service. SPNs are crucial for services like SQL Server, IIS, and others that use Kerberos for secure communication.

\textbf{Signature Validation}

Kerberos signature validation is a crucial security mechanism within the Kerberos authentication protocol, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of messages and tickets exchanged during authentication and authorization processes. It involves verifying digital signatures on various Kerberos components, primarily the Privileged Attribute Certificate (PAC), to prevent malicious tampering and unauthorized privilege escalation.

\textbf{Shadow Domain Admin}

A shadow domain admin refers to a user account that possesses administrator-level privileges within a domain, but is not officially part of the designated domain administrator group. These accounts often go unnoticed by security teams because they don't appear in standard administrative listings, making them a potential security risk.

\textbf{User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)}

User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) is a cybersecurity solution that uses machine learning and data analytics to detect suspicious activities by analyzing the behavior of users and other entities within an organization's network. By establishing baseline behaviors, UEBA identifies anomalies that may indicate security threats, such as insider threats or compromised accounts.
