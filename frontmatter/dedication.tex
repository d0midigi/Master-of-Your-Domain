\chapter*{Dedication}
\textit{To my first-born daughter, Alyssa Marie - You are the moment everything changed. The day you were born and I first held you in my arms was the day I learned the true meaning of unconditional love. You made me a mother and becoming your mother gave me a purpose that I desperately craved in my life. You have taught me grace through challenge, joy in the smallest moments, and pride beyond measure. You inspire me to believe in myself and to be the best version of myself. Through you, I live vicariously. You are my guide light, my motivation and the reason why I dream bigger. You are my calm, my courage, and my constant reminder of the love that never ends. I see the best of me in you and everything I strive to become.

\textit{To my son, Jayden Christopher, you are my rainbow that came after the storm, the light that followed my darkest days. After an unimaginable loss, you arrived and brought healing that I did not know was possible. Your existence is a promise fulfilled, a prayer answered, and a symbol of hope that love always finds its way back. You are my calm, my rock, and my quiet strength. Always looking out for me, always reminding me to keep going, whether it is nudging me to get up for work or simply standing beside me with that knowing heart of yours. You are my safe place, my gentle guide, and the reminder that from pain comes beauty and from heartbreak comes joy. I thank the universe every day for you. You didn't just fill a void - you built something whole and unshakable in its place.

\textit{To my baby, Damien Robert - my fierce little heart. You completed our family with your fire, charm, and your endless hugs. You are my firecracker, my light, my "spelling turtle," and my laughter. From the moment you entered my life, you have filled it with boundless energy, affection, and joy. Your imagination is wild and beautiful, your hugs are healing, and your love is pure magic for my soul. You remind me every day to live in moment, to laugh loudly, and to love without limits. You complete our family in ways only you could, and I am endlessly grateful for the spark you bring into my world. You are my sunshine, my strength, and my sweetest adventure. Watching you grow is one of my life's greatest joys.

\textit{To my Mother, my Father, and my brother - your love is the foundation of everything I am. You have lifted me through my lowest moments and cheered me on through every victory and were there in my corner for every loss. Mom, your warmth and compassion live in the everything I do. Dad, your strength and steady presence give me courage to chase dreams bigger than myself. And to my brother - your loyalty, humor, and unspoken understanding have kept me grounded when life felt too heavy. Thank you for standing by me, for believing in me, and for loving me unconditionally even when I didn't have the words to ask for it. This journey is ours - always.
